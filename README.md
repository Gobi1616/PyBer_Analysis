# PyBer_Analysis

## Background

This repository provides a python pandas method for analysing the ride-sharing data by city type. Further, utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph depicting total weekly fares for each city form is developed. Both datasets were downloaded, combined, and the aggregate data was displayed in python pandas dataframes for these analyses. Finally, a published paper summarising how the data varies by city form and how PyBer decision-makers should use these variations.

## Overview of the analysis:

PyBer Challenge (PyBer) Overview of the Research: Describe what the latest research is about. The aim of this written report is to compile a DataFrame that summarises ride-sharing data by city form. This report will also include multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for every city category, created with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

## Results:

In the above Figure 1: Total Fare by City Type, The distinction between rural, metropolitan, and suburban city types can be seen in the graph above. Between the months of January and April, the fare in urban cities is the highest and most stable. Rural city fares are the cheapest of the three city types, and unlike the Urban and Suburban city types, the fares never cross.

Despite the fact that the fares never cross, the Urban fares start at an average of $1,800 and rise to $2,300 as when the months have gone. The Suburban fares, on the other hand, began at $1,000; however, the pattern was not constant, as the fare fell in March and even further in mid-April. Rural fares began at $200 and continued to rise and fall until the end of April. Below Figure 2: The total number of rides per City Type, Summary of plotted fares for city type over time and the plot supports observations also found in the summary data; Urban fare totals are much bigger than Suburban with are bigger than Rural.

## Summary: 

Summary of the Riding according to the Pyber Rides Summary results, this seems like what most people are expecting. Total Rides: There are three times as many rides in urban areas as there are in suburban areas, which are four times as many as there are in rural areas. Total Drivers: Drivers in urban areas are significantly higher, owing to the presence of more bus lines and regular coverage.

As shown in the Figure 1 line graph, both pie bars show Urban city form, which has the most city drivers and riders and is consistent in price and trend. Urban areas have many more drivers, likely accounted for having more bus lines or longer daily coverage.
Cumulative Fares display anticipated interruptions, not even in the same way that Total Rides do. Rural areas generate more per trip than Suburban areas, which generate more than Urban areas. Longer distances in rural areas can account for this, with each ride costing more.
